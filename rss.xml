            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Rising dawn: Rolls-Royce debut handsome new soft-top.</h1><p>The Rolls-Royce Dawn made its debut in an underground car park, just a stone's throw from Wallpaper's HQ. Granted, it was the car park beneath Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners' award-winning Neo Bankside development, and the other bays were full of Ferraris, Maseratis and other exotic metal.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4e9722ec934a561a202db1ac3eff4119777420ed.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Clever Headrest That Could Make Flying Actually Bearable</h1><p>There are many reasons to hate flying economy. The tiny seats, the inedible food, the fees airlines charge for things you'd get for free in a medieval dungeon. Manon KÃ¼hne can't fix any of that, but she's has found one small way to make sitting in 17C just a bit less hellish.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8dc283ca637a9ed4e81f27749130ffccde596046.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Assignment of a Lifetime: Riding in a U-2 Spy Plane at the Edge of Space</h1><p>Back in 2010, San Francisco-based photographer Christopher Michel received a once-in-a-lifetime photo assignment from the US Navel Institute: to ride in the back seat of a U-2 spy plane at the "edge of space." At the plane's cruising and intelligence-gathering altitude of 70,000 feet above the ground, temperatures outside the plane fall to 70 degrees below zero.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/04f6c0633f5a485f90dde99e96cd653a67f86bd6.jpg"></article>]]></description>
